    <p>
      I am a physics Ph.D. student at Columbia University. I work with Szabolcs
      and Zsuzsa Marka on Gravitational Wave Astronomy for <a
      href="http://ligo.org">LIGO</a>. My <a href="https://github.com/stefco">
      GitHub profile page</a> contains some of my work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy programming in <code>bash</code> (Bourne Again SHell) and 
      <code>julia</code>.

      If you are using a Mac, you should give
      <a href="https://www.iterm2.com">iTerm</a> a try, not because Mac's
      default terminal is unacceptable, but because iTerm has a couple of nice
      features (like split panes) that are inexplicably lacking from terminal.

      <code>vim</code> is a great, lightweight, ubiquitous text editor. You can
      go through a quick and very informative tutorial on any system that has
      it installed by running <code>vimtutor</code> at the command line.

    <h2>Useful LIGO Links</h2>
    <p>
      Getting started with LIGO is somewhat difficult due to the scattered
      nature of documentation. Below are some useful links that are very easy
      to forget. They all require LIGO credentials.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I maintain a <a href="geco_vm">
          virtual machine with all the LIGO software you probably need
        </a> installed on it; you should probably use this virtual
        machine for almost any work you are going to do (particularly
        if you are with the Columbia gravitational wave group).
      </li>
      <li>
        Go to <a href="https://my.ligo.org/auth.php?do=logout">my.ligo.org</a>
        to manage basic account information or to sign up for LIGO credentials.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can manage your email listserv subscriptions at
        <a href="https://sympa.ligo.org/wws/lists">sympa.ligo.org</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        LIGO has <em>way</em> too many
        <a href="https://wiki.ligo.org/LSC/BeginnersGuide/AcronymList">
        acronyms</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you want to log into LIGO servers (which is something you almost
        certainly will want to do), 
        <a href="https://wiki.ligo.org/LDG/GettingStarted">
          follow these instructions
        </a> to get LIGO DataGrid credentials.

        If you are trying to remotely access data, e.g. get timeseries or
        view MEDM controll screens from offsite, 
        <a href="https://wiki.ligo.org/RemoteAccess/WebHome">you should visit
        this</a> wiki page.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you need detailed logs of goings on at the observatories, visit the
        <a href="https://alog.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/aLOG/">Hanford alog site</a>
        for logs regarding the Hanford detector and the
        <a href="https://alog.ligo-la.caltech.edu/aLOG/">Livingston alog
        site</a> for logs regarding the Livingston detector.

        Every file you could ever need is <em>ostensibly</em> 
        <a href="https://dcc.ligo.org/dcc">stored on DCC</a>,
        though finding the file you need will likely be impossible
        if you don't already know how to search for it. (Sorry!)
      </li>
      <li>
        LIGO's subversion repositories, containing much important code, are
        <a href="https://redoubt.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/websvn/?">here</a>.

      It is also worth knowing that there is a new type of frame in addition
      to the standard ones, which I believe is dedicated to h(t):
      <code>L1_HOFT_C01</code> and <code>H1_HOFT_C01</code>.

    <h2>Controversial Opinions, or, an Invective Against Pythonistas</h2>
    <p>
      <code>bash</code> has idiosyncracies but, unlike <code>python</code> and
      other hyped languages of the 2000s, it has poetry. Many people are quite
      confused by this and mistake e.g. their own fear of regular expressions
      for a sign that <code>sed</code> is hard to use. The UNIX philosophy is
      similarly all-right with me. Simple but powerful is good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many people think they need IDEs; this is
      false. The command line is an IDE. <code>vi</code>, <code>sed</code>,
      <code>grep</code> et al. are the best editing tools around. And the
      command line is extensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the other end of the self-consistency spectrum is <code>julia</code>,
      whose creators' relentless persuit of crystalline conceptual perfection
      has wrought a terse, fast, clean, and&mdash;like <code>bash</code>&mdash;
      flexible language. In <code>julia</code>, everything makes sense.
      Everything is beautiful. There is more than one way to do things because
      we are all adults.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have not learned <code>perl</code>, but the fact that "pythonistas"
      seem to dislike it suggests that it is a very good language.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>python</code> is a good language. For many tasks it is the most
      reasonable choice. Trying to argue that it is the best scripting language
      to use, or that other languages are foul-smelling, is somewhat like
      insisting that you are only capable of eating chicken nuggets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compare <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~xela/tao.html">The Tao of
      Programming</a>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "Technique?" said the programmer, turning from his terminal, "What I
      follow is Tao -- beyond all techniques! When I first began to program,
      I would see before me the whole problem in one mass. After three years,
      I no longer saw this mass. Instead, I used subroutines. But now I see
      nothing. My whole being exists in a formless void. My senses are idle.
      My spirit, free to work without a plan, follows its own instinct. In
      short, my program writes itself. True, sometimes there are difficult
      problems. I see them coming, I slow down, I watch silently. Then I
      change a single line of code and the difficulties vanish like puffs of
      idle smoke. I then compile the program. I sit still and let the joy of
      the work fill my being. I close my eyes for a moment and then log off."

      There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
