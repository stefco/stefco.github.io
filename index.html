        OVERVIEW<br/>
        ========
      </h1>

      <p>
        I'm a physics Ph.D. candidate at Columbia University in 
        <a href="http://geco.markalab.org">Szabolcs Marka's group</a> working
        on multi-messenger astrophysics (MMA) using gravitational waves (GW)
        and high energy neutrinos. I wrote and maintan
        <a href='http://multimessenger.science'>LLAMA</a>, a cutting-edge MMA
        search pipeline and software framework implementing the world's first
        GW+neutrino online search pipeline. I have also worked extensively on
        LIGO's timing system hardware and diagnostic software as well as
        education and outreach.
      </p>

      <h1>
        RESEARCH<br/>
        ========
      </h1>

      <h2>
        LATE PHD RESEARCH: GW/NEUTRINO MULTI-MESSENGER PIPELINE<br/>
        -------------------------------------------------------
      </h2>

      <p>
        In the late Initial LIGO and early (O1) Advanced LIGO eras, my team
        spearheaded the first GW/neutrino offline
        <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.1140">searches</a>. During aLIGO's
        second observing run (O2), I 
        <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05486">took their method online</a>
        by creating a software framework,
        <a href="http://multimessenger.science/">LLAMA</a>
        (Low-Latency Algorithm for Multi-messenger Astrophysics), for
        conducting this GW/neutrino search and
        disseminating results in low-latency. LLAMA was the world's first
        fully-automated low-latency GW/neutrino search pipeline and the first
        automated GW follow-up search to include spatial priors in its
        calculations. It proved to be highly reliable and was regularly the
        fastest GW follow-up search to run during O2. Follow-up with IceCube
        high-energy neutrinos was performed
        for all LIGO/Virgo O2 triggers, including historic
        <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.161101">kilonova
        GW170817;</a> sub-threshold joint triggers overlapping with the
        original 1-detector GW skymap were
        <a href="https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/21508.gcn3">successfully
        distributed</a> and followed up by some EM
        partners, but improved GW skymap localizations showed a
        non-coincidence. The LLAMA framework was also used during O2 to run
        critical diagnostic checks of LIGO's timing system. It processed
        public triggers and demonstrated the ability to process LIGO
        sub-threshold triggers as well (though actual significance and
        plotting steps could not performed on sub-threshold triggers without
        code review).  I used an advanced architecture, cloud-hosting
        solutions, and other advanced devops practices (which are only now
        becoming standard practice in MMA efforts) to achieve its exceptional
        performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        For O3, my team and I developed
        <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11467">an improved Bayesian
        significance calculation</a> for our pipeline that uses other
        astrophysical source data to boost sensitivity. This search method
        relies on a general Bayesian odds ratio which can be readily extended
        to other messenger types and 3+ detectors. During this time, I also
        added extensive reliability and performance improvements and wrote a
        highly performant multi-resolution HEALPix math library to ensure that
        LLAMA could run quickly and reliably with arbitrary
        spatial-prior-motivated core significance calculations. This was done
        to ensure that the new Bayesian method would work for GW/neutrino
        searches as well as any extensions added during O3. LLAMA has been
        running with the new code during O3, regularly finishing in less than a
        minute from GW trigger generation time (though IceCube result
        dissemination time has been longer due to humans-in-the-loop).
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout this time, I gained highly extensive expertise in software
        development/operations methods and and astrophysics infrastructure by
        creating software tools in support of my entire team's scientific
        goals (many of these tools can be found in <a href="https://github.com/stefco/geco_data">these</a> <a href="https://github.com/stefco/geco_plots">three</a> <a href="https://github.com/stefco/geco_channels">repositories</a>).
        I developed advanced software for data retrieval, caching, validating,
        cleaning, and formatting, all highly non-trivial tasks due to LIGO's
        large data volumes and limited infrastructure. This also required
        developing <a href="https://github.com/stefco/geco_vm">virtual</a> <a href="https://github.com/stefco/ligo-vm">machines</a>, cloud-hosted images, provisioning
        <a href="https://github.com/stefco/geco_env">scripts</a>, and <a href=http://multimessenger.science/">extensive</a> <a href="https://github.com/stefco/geco_docs">documentation</a> to cope with the tremendous
        operational complexity of using constantly-changing experimental (in
        all senses of the word) scientific libraries with limited support and
        documentation.  My teammate Rainer Corley and I extensively documented
        the photodiode layout of the Interferometer Sensing and Control (ISC)
        system (a crucial susbsytem used for scientific data collection and
        interferometer control) and <a href="https://github.com/stefco/isc">created</a> an interactive <a href="http://isc-ligo.multimessenger.science">installation map</a>
        showing the layout and operation of the whole system. I many other
        contributions to detector operations, like making useful LIGO tools
        <a href="https://github.com/stefco/macports-ports">available on MacPorts</a> and adding control interfaces to LIGO's
        EPICS/MEDM industrial control system. I also used my technical
        expertise to make modest non-astrohysics contributions to to my
        group's <a href="https://github.com/stefco/mousewalker">public health</a> efforts. (Much of my publically-available work
        is linked above; some of the rest is spread across DCC, ArXiV,
        BitBucket, and my GitHub.)

      <h2>
        UNDERGRAD & EARLY PHD RESEARCH: LIGO TIMING SYSTEM<br/>
        --------------------------------------------------
      </h2>

      <p>
        I started working with the Marka group as an undergraduate at Columbia.
        During this time I contributed to the development of Advanced LIGO's
        timing system, which my group was building from scratch to address
        weaknesses in Initial LIGO's commercially-built timing system. I
        debugged FPGA timing code; developed documentation and workflows for
        assembly, firmware-flashing, and testing; and personally assembled,
        tested, and shipped most of Advanced LIGO and KAGRA's timing system.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the beginning of my Ph.D., I resumed my undergraduate work on
        LIGO's timing system. I developed diagnostic systems and software to
        ensure the timing system's reliability. This involved developing
        remote-work tools, devops methods (like virtual-machine images),
        <a href="https://github.com/stefco/geco_channels">installation</a> documentation, maintenance <a href="https://github.com/stefco/geco_timing_checklists">procedures</a>,
        and documentation that enabled timing system supervision from NYC.
        Thanks in large part to these efforts, my group has maintained the
        timing systems at both LIGO sites (this is no small accomplishment;
        the Columbia group is the only group that manages and maintains
        mission-critical LIGO hardware from off-site. The timing system has
        flawlessly through the Advanced LIGO era, enabling precise event
        reconstruction and source localization in support of LIGO's historic,
        Nobel-prize-winning detections. Japan's KAGRA GW detector will also
        rely on our proven timing system.
