    <h1>Stefan Countryman</h1>
    <p>
      I am a physics Ph.D. student at Columbia University. I work with Szabolcs
      and Zsuzsa Marka on Gravitational Wave Astronomy for <a
      href="http://ligo.org">LIGO</a>. My <a href="https://github.com/stefco">
      GitHub profile page</a> contains some of my work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy programming in <code>python</code>, <code>bash</code> (Bourne Again SHell) and 
      <code>julia</code>.
    </p>
    <h2>Useful Links, Tips, and Tricks</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="http://linuxcommand.org">This</a> and
      <a href="http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sh.html">this</a> are wonderful
      resources for learning <code>bash</code>.
      <a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/string-manipulation.html#STRINGMANIP">
        This
      </a> is a good guide to `bash` built-in string manipulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Go
      <a href="http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/sed.html">here</a> to learn how to
      use <code>sed</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are using a Mac, you should give
      <a href="https://www.iterm2.com">iTerm</a> a try, not because Mac's
      default terminal is unacceptable, but because iTerm has a couple of nice
      features (like split panes and excellent <code>tmux</code> integration) 
      that are inexplicably lacking from terminal.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the topic of terminal tools, you should use <code>tmux</code> for
      managing remote sessions that you want to resume later. It's great for
      working on long-running remote projects across multiple devices or when
      worrying about spotty connection quality. It even has mouse support in
      Windows 10, making iTerm2 less of a killer app for Mac remote work. (On
      that topic, you should use Windows Subsystem for Linux if you are
      running Windows 10 in order to get a fairly uniform UNIX environment
      across your computing environments. LIGO is UNIX geared, so even if you
      prefer Windows, it is worth immersing yourself in UNIX-style
      environments to avoid headaches).
      <a href="http://tangledhelix.com/blog/2012/07/16/tmux-and-mouse-mode/">

      <code>vim</code> is a great, lightweight, ubiquitous text editor. You can
      go through a quick and very informative tutorial on any system that has
      it installed by running <code>vimtutor</code> at the command line.

      DigitalOcean provides great, cheap, fast, modular server hosting. And they
      have great beginner-friendly tutorials on subjects like

      Does XQuartz launch whenever you fire up <code>vim</code>, causing slow startup?
      Turns out <code>vim</code> feels out its environment on startup by checking variables,
      including <code>$DISPLAY</code>, whose value is something like
      <pre>
        <code>
          /private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.muoEIdGNPd/org.macosforge.xquartz:0
        </code>
      </pre>
      Somehow that check causes XQuartz to launch (even though <code>vim</code> won't use it).
      My solution is to set <code>$DISPLAY</code> to <code>null</code> <em>only</em> for
      <code>vim</code>-related commands by aliasing them in <code>~/.bash_profile</code>
      (which Mac uses instead of ~/.bashrc):
      <pre>
        <code>
          # prevent xquartz from opening
          alias view='DISPLAY="" view'
          alias vi='DISPLAY="" vi'
          alias vim='DISPLAY="" vim'
          alias vimdiff='DISPLAY="" vimdiff'
          alias vimtutor='DISPLAY="" vimtutor'
        </code>
      </pre>
      You can take a similar approach to avoid the
      <pre>
        <code>
          crontab: temp file must be edited in place
        </code>
      </pre>
      error when editing your crontab with vim. Just add:
      <pre>
        <code>
          alias crontab="VIM_CRONTAB=true crontab"
        </code>
      </pre>
      to your <code>bash</code> dotfile, then edit your <code>.vimrc</code>
      file to include:
      <pre>
        <code>
          :if $VIM_CRONTAB == "true"
          :set nobackup
          :set nowritebackup
          :endif
        </code>
      </pre>

    <h2>Useful LIGO Links</h2>
    <p>
      Getting started with LIGO is somewhat difficult due to the scattered
      nature of documentation. Below are some useful links that are very easy
      to forget. They all require LIGO credentials.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://software.ligo.org/docs/lalsuite/lalsuite/">
          Here is the LALSuite documentation
        </a>, including stuff like LALSimulation and LALInspiral.
      </li>
      <li>
        I maintain a <a href="geco_vm">
          virtual machine with all the LIGO software you probably need
        </a> installed on it; you should probably use this virtual
        machine for almost any work you are going to do (particularly
        if you are with the Columbia gravitational wave group).
      </li>
      <li>
        LIGO has a nice <a href="https://segments-web.ligo.org/">
          online viewer for data quality segments.
        </a>
      </li>
      <li>
        If you need to install LIGO software, here is a
        <a href="https://wiki.ligo.org/DASWG/SoftwareDownloads">
          collection of links to installation instructions for different
          operating systems
        </a>, including Debian 8, SL7, and Mac OS.
      </li>
      <li>
        Need LIGO authentication for a command-line script, like a <code>curl</code>
        request to GraceDB? Go

        Want to ssh in to LIGO datagrid servers with tools that don't
        support <code>gsissh</code>? Just use the <code>.ssh/config</code>
        options <code>ControlMaster</code>, <code>ControlPath</code>, and
        <code>ControlPersist</code> (documented in
        <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-custom-connection-options-for-your-ssh-client">

        A great introduction to data flow in LIGO on the 
        <a href="https://ldvw.ligo.caltech.edu/ldvw/view">

        <a href="https://ldvw.ligo.caltech.edu/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=ldvwdoc">
            here
        </a>. LigoDV-Web is a good tool for generating quick plots of small
        chunks of data using a web-GUI (which also makes is usable from any
        device). It even prints the plotting command used to generate each
        plot. That said, it relies on NDS and is no good for anything involving
        large quantities of data.

        If you need to download LIGO stuff from the command line, there are
        several types of authentication strategies you can use. There are also
        some premade scripts for one-off LIGO downloads called
        <code>ligocurl</code> and <code>dcc-get</code> for fetching stuff via
        command line from protected web servers (specifically DCC in the latter
        instance). This stuff is all available on the

        The CDS (Control and Data System) pages at the two sites:

        and
        <a href="https://lhocds.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/">LHO CDS</a>.
        <strong>

        If you are trying to remotely access data, e.g. get timeseries or
        view MEDM controll screens from offsite, 
        <a href="https://wiki.ligo.org/RemoteAccess/WebHome">you should visit

        Every file you could ever need is <em>ostensibly</em> 
        <a href="https://dcc.ligo.org/dcc">stored on DCC</a>,

        LIGO's subversion repositories, containing much important code, are
        <a href="https://redoubt.ligo-wa.caltech.edu/websvn/?">here</a>. If you
        ever want to work on a subversion repository, you can "checkout" the
        repository (this is equivalent to <code>git clone url</code>) with
        <code>svn checkout --username albert.einstein url</code>, where, of
        course, the username is your own and the URL is that of the repository
        you want to work with. Be prepared for a very big disk footprint and a
        very long wait; some of these repositories are huge. If you want a more
        in-depth description of SVN (tailored to Git users), check out
        <a href="https://git-scm.com/course/svn.html">

      It is also worth knowing that there is a new type of frame in addition
      to the standard ones, which I believe is dedicated to h(t):
      <code>L1_HOFT_C01</code> and <code>H1_HOFT_C01</code>.

      He is an excellent pup with a rapid growth rate, indicating good
      parenting. Battle shortly after we got him:

      He is growing very quickly, at a rate of approx. 70%/3 weeks. Following

    <h2>Controversial Opinions, or, an Invective Against Pythonistas</h2>
    <p>
      <code>bash</code> has idiosyncracies but, unlike <code>python</code> and
      other more popular scripting languages, it has poetry and humor. Many
      people are quite confused by this and mistake e.g. their own fear of
      regular expressions for a sign that <code>sed</code> is hard to use. The
      UNIX philosophy is similarly all-right with me. Simple but powerful is
      good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many people think they need IDEs; this is
      false. The command line is an IDE. <code>vi</code>, <code>sed</code>,
      <code>grep</code> et al. are the best editing tools around. And the
      command line is extensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the other end of the self-consistency spectrum is <code>julia</code>,
      whose creators' relentless persuit of perfection
      has wrought a terse, fast, clean, and&mdash;like <code>bash</code>&mdash;
      flexible language. In <code>julia</code>, everything makes sense.
      Everything is beautiful. There is more than one way to do things because
      we are all adults.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have not learned <code>perl</code>, but the fact that "pythonistas"
      seem to dislike it suggests that it is a very good language.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>python</code> is a good language. For many tasks it is the most
      reasonable choice. Trying to argue that it is <strong>always</strong>
      the only scripting language to use, or that other scripting languages
      are foul-smelling, is like insisting that you are only
      capable of eating chicken nuggets.

      Compare <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~xela/tao.html">The Tao of
      Programming</a>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "Technique?" said the programmer, turning from his terminal, "What I
      follow is Tao -- beyond all techniques! When I first began to program,
      I would see before me the whole problem in one mass. After three years,
      I no longer saw this mass. Instead, I used subroutines. But now I see
      nothing. My whole being exists in a formless void. My senses are idle.
      My spirit, free to work without a plan, follows its own instinct. In
      short, my program writes itself. True, sometimes there are difficult
      problems. I see them coming, I slow down, I watch silently. Then I
      change a single line of code and the difficulties vanish like puffs of
      idle smoke. I then compile the program. I sit still and let the joy of
      the work fill my being. I close my eyes for a moment and then log off."

      There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

      In my defense, I would be writing more <code>bash</code> scripts if not
      for the fact that all of my colleagues hate it.

        Someone else

      pitfalls of Java as a language, implementation, and set of conventions.

        great piece
      </a> about object obsession (at the expense of functions), which of
