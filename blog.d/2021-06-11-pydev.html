    This post is meant to help you quickly get a nice, maintainable python
    environment up and running.
    <strong>
      Feel free to just follow the instructions in the TL;DR section,
      referencing the extended explanations as needed (I won't be offended).
    </strong>
    </p>

    <h2>
    TL;DR<br>
    -----
    </h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <a href="#sec1">Set up your interpreter</a>.
        Install <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">Anaconda</a>
        [<a href="https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2021.05-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg">MacOS</a>]
        [<a href="https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2021.05-Windows-x86_64.exe">Win</a>]
        [<a href="https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2021.05-Linux-x86_64.sh">Linux</a>].
        If it asks you whether you'd like to install
        <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a> as well, say
        yes if you don't have it installed already (in which case you can skip
        step 2).
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="#sec2">Track your dependencies</a>.
        Find a list of all of your dependencies, ideally manually, and put them
        in a conda environment YAML file called something like
        <code>your-project-env.yml</code>. Update this environment as you
        install/remove new packages for your project.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="#sec3">Pick an IDE/Editor</a>.
        Install <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download">PyCharm</a>
        (if you didn't already do it while installing Anaconda).
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>
    MOTIVATION<br/>
    ----------
    </h2>

    <p>
    Developing multiple python projects with arcane dependencies using the
    naive approach (install one copy of python, <code>pip --install</code> a
    bunch of packages by hand, lose track of which projects need which
    packages, face a dependency conflict, suffer, despair) will ruin your
    computer and your life.
    When it comes to dependency management, packaging, writing extensions, and
    even choosing an interpreter, a web search will show dozens of ways to do
    the same thing, most of them obsolete, overwrought, unmaintainable, slow,
    bug-ridden, inextensible, or otherwise terrible.
    </p>

    <p>
    This presents a problem to the novice programmer, who has heard that python
    is easy to learn and has many useful libraries that you can freely use,
    and therefore starts a project without setting up a decent dev environment,
    not realizing what horrors await them.
    Fortunately, practices are improving somewhat, and with a bit of guidance,
    managing python projects can be as forgiving to novice programmers as the
    syntax of the code itself.
    </p>

    <p>
    The aim of this post is to provide such a guide to my friends and
    colleagues in a central place.

    SET UP YOUR INTERPRETER<br/<>
    -----------------------
    </h2>

    <p>
    The first thing to do is to install an actual python interpreter.
    Python is a scripting language, meaning that the programs are just text
    files which are executed by a program called an <em>interpreter</em>.
    The language itself changes roughly every year, so you will probably want
    an interpreter that runs a recent version of the language, as well as the
    ability to manage multiple versions (in case you find that certain of your
    programs require older/newer versions than what you typically run).
    </p>

    <p>
    MacOS computers come with a very old version of python pre-installed.
    Linux machines sometimes come with a newer version pre-installed, though
    very minimal distributions will come without a python interpreter
    altogether.
    MacOS, most Linux distributions, and Windows all have <em>system</em>
    package managers (either official, like <code>apt</code> on Debian Linux,
    or third party, like MacPorts or Homebrew on MacOS/Chocolatey on Windows)
    that let you quickly install a version of python;
    <strong>don't use them.</strong>
    They are tied in to various tools throughout your system, so that breaking
    them might break system-wide tools you depend on, and they tend to be
    incomplete and out of date.
    Installing python and libraries
    [<a id="link-to-footnote1" href="#footnote1">1</a>]
    using the system package manager means
    possibly having to remove and reinstall everything in your fragile dev
    environment at some point in the future, which can easily take over a day
    for complex environments, assuming it's possible at all.
    This violates what is, in my opinion, the most important rule of a
    development environment:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      It should be easy to destroy and rebuild your dev environment.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Having this property means you will never live in fear of the day when you
    inevitably mess up your configuration and need to delete it all and start
    over.
    You will not fear adding new team members or switching development
    computers, and chances are your deployments will become much easier.
    </p>

    <p>
    The (likely) easiest solution is to use Anaconda's python distribution,
    which includes a nice, fast, cross-platform python package manager
    (<code>conda</code>) and a nice development environment management system,
    which I'll discuss in the next section.
    </p>

    <h2>
    <a id="sec2"></a>
    TRACK YOUR DEPENDENCIES (IN A CONDA ENVIRONMENT)<br/>
    ------------------------------------------------
    </h2>

    <p>
    You can use Anaconda to create distinct Python environments for each
    project you are working on.
    You can create a new environment (with no packages yet installed) using
    <code>conda create -n my-environment-name</code>, list your existing python
    environments with <code>conda env list</code>, and activate the one you want
    (e.g. <code>my-environment-name</code>)
    with <code>conda activate my-environment-name</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
    In general, the easiest way to manage your environments is to have a single
    file which specifies all the dependencies, allowing you to install all of
    them with a single command.
    <code>pip</code> allows you to do this with what is usually referred to as
    a requirements file, called <code>requirements.txt</code> by convention.
    The Conda approach is more powerful; it uses a
    <a href='https://yaml.org/'>YAML</a> file which optionally includes
    information about the python version and environment name as well as the
    ability to specify <code>pip</code> dependencies (since more niche packages
    usually need to be installed that way).
    </p>

    <p>
    If you already have a conda environment file called, e.g.,
    <code>env.yml</code> for an environment
    called <code>my-environment-name</code>, you can simply run
    <code>conda env create -f env.yml</code>, and it will install all required
    packages; you can then activate the environment with
    <code>conda activate my-environment-name</code> and start using it.
    Such an environment file's contents might look as simple as:
    </p>
    <pre class='code'>
name: my-environment-name
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - python=3.9
  - numpy
  - pip
  - pip:
    - nptyping==1.4.4</pre>

    <p>
    In this example, we are allowing Anaconda to install Python version 3.9, as
    well as packages from
    <code>conda-forge</code> (which is user-maintained and contains most
    packages); more precisely, we are installing Numpy using the
    <code>conda</code> package manager; and we are installing a more niche
    package, <code>nptyping</code>, using <code>pip</code>, since it's not
    available on <code>conda-forge</code>.
    We specify our <code>pip</code> dependencies as a list under
    <code>-pip:</code>, but we also need to explicitly install the
    <code>pip</code> package manager itself using <code>conda</code> in order
    to be able to do so.
    We've required <code>nptyping</code> to use a specific version (1.4.4)
    while allowing Numpy to default to the latest version; in general, it's
    usually easiest to leave the version numbers unspecified until the point
    where specific versions are required to avoid bugs you've found.
    Finally, we have also specified the name of the environment; both this and
    the Python version are optional, but it's nice to be extra specific with
    these just to make sure things work.
    </p>

    <p>
    You can get a list of all top-level imported packages in your
    codebase by running this command (for regular <code>.py</code> python
    files):
    </p>

    <pre class='code'>
find . -name '*py' -exec sed -n 's/^import *\([^ .]*\).*/\1/p;s/^from *\([^ .]*\) *import.*/\1/p' {} \; | sort | uniq</pre>

    <p>
    or this command (for (<code>.ipynb</code> Jupyter notebook files), which
    requires you to install
    <a href='https://stedolan.github.io/jq/'><code>jq</code></a> for JSON
    parsing [<a id="link-to-footnote2" href="#footnote2">2</a>]:

    <pre class='code'>
find . -name '*ipynb' -exec jq -jr '.cells | .[].source | .[]' {} \; | sed -n 's/^import *\([^ .]*\).*/\1/p;s/^from *\([^ .]*\) *import.*/\1/p' | sort | uniq</pre>

    <p>
    or handle both types of files in one fell swoop:
    </p>

    <pre class='code'>
(
    find . -name '*ipynb' -exec jq -jr '.cells | .[].source | .[]' {} \;
    find . -name '*py' -exec cat {} \;
) \
    | sed -n 's/^import *\([^ .]*\).*/\1/p;s/^from *\([^ .]*\) *import.*/\1/p' \
    | sort \
    | uniq</pre>

    <p>
    </p>

    <p>
    Note that the names of packages on conda or pip might differ from the
    imported package names, and this won't tell you which versions are required
    (which can be vital for getting complex numerical environments working
    properly).
    If you can't get your code to work on a newly-built environment,
    you might want to see exactly which versions of each package you
    have installed by running <code>pip freeze</code> in whichever
    environment you are already using. You should see a bunch of items
    that look like e.g. <code>typish==1.9.3</code>.
    Alternatively, if you've already been using <code>conda</code> to manage
    your dependencies, you can directly export an environment file with
    <code>conda env export >my-env.yml</code> (substituting
    <code>my-env.yml</code> with whatever you want to call your environment);
    this output will include information about the source of each package, i.e.
    whether it was from
    <a href='https://pypi.org/'>PyPI</a> (using
    <code>pip</code>) or from <a href='https://conda-forge.org/'>
      <code>conda-forge</code></a> (using <code>conda</code>).
    </p>

    <p>
    In both cases, you'll end up with a <em>full</em> list of installed
    packages; most of these will probably be dependencies of the packages you
    are actually using.
    If you're taking this approach, it's good to delete everything that doesn't
    appear in the above <code>find</code> command, unless you really need a
    specific version <em>or</em> want a specific record of installed packages
    that worked for your project.

    PICK AN IDE/EDITOR<br/>
    ------------------
    </h2>

    <p>
    You don't <em>really</em> need an
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">
      integrated development environment
    </a>
    (IDE, i.e. a program for editing and running your code)
    for python dev, since <code>ipython</code>, Jupyter, <code>ripgrep</code>,
    and your favorite text editor can handle 98% of what you'd need an IDE for.
    If you're command-line savvy and have a favorite text editor, you can keep
    using your favorite tools quite easily.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you're not yet a command-line guru, however, you should try a nice IDE
    like <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a>.
    It has great code exploration, debugging, and running/testing tools built
    in, with full support for various arcane interpreter setups (in case you
    need to deviate in the future from the set up I suggest in this post), and
    is cross-platform.
    The community version is free and adequate for most purposes.

    [<a id="footnote1" href="#link-to-footnote1">1</a>]
    Seasoned python devs might correctly observe that you could simply use a
    <code>virtualenv</code>.
    This is a valid technique, but it does not solve the related problem of
    picking and installing an interpreter (let alone managing multiple
    versions), nor of the limitations of
    <code>pip</code> or the inconvenience of having virtual environments
    scattered all over your dev folders.
    <code>pipenv</code> uses <code>virtualenv</code> and tracks your
    dependencies automatically, but anything that <code>pipenv</code> is
    capable of automatically tracking is going to be very easy to track or
    reconstruct manually, reducing it's utility (not to mention it was slow and
    buggy last I used it) [<a id="link-to-footnote3" href="#footnote3">3</a>].
    </p>

    <p>
    [<a id="footnote2" href="#link-to-footnote2">2</a>]
    You can easily install <code>jq</code> with e.g. <code>brew install jq</code>
    (MacOS using Homebrew) or <code>choco install jq</code> (Windows using
    Chocolatey); see <a href='./2022-08-06-react-0-to-1.html'>react 0 to 1</a>
    for relevant links.
    </p>

    <p>
    [<a id="footnote3" href="#link-to-footnote3">3</a>]
    If the latter is critical to getting your code to work, however, you might
    want to go one step further and immortalize your environment in a docker
    image.
    It's more work, but for some numerical/scientific environments, it's the
    <em>only</em> convenient way to have a portable and reusable environment
    for running your code.
    </p>
