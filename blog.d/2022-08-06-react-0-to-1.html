    This very short list of links is meant to get you up and running developing
    an application in React JS.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Preliminarily: you probably want to be using Powershell on Windows or
        Terminal on MacOS to enter the required commands.. If you're on Linux I assume you know how to open a
        terminal. If you're new to the shell, you can follow
        <a href="http://linuxcommand.org">
          this guide
        </a> to learn the basics of navigation and Bash scripting. This applies
        on either MacOS or Linux, though many of the commands
        (<code>mv, ls, cd, mkdir, pwd,</code> and others) will work in their
        simplest forms in Powershell.
      </li>
      <li>
        Install a package manager if on <a href="https://brew.sh">
          MacOS
        </a> or <a href="https://chocolatey.org/install">
          Windows
        </a> (Linux distros should already come with a package manager)
      </li>
      <li>
        Install Node Version Manager using a package manager or from
        <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm">
          the official install script
        </a>. Package manager installation will look something like:
        <ul>
          <li>On MacOS, run <code>brew install nvm</code></li>
          <li>On Windows, run <code>choco install nvm</code></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Use nvm to install (at least) the minimal version of Node specified on the
        <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app">
          create-react-app installation instructions page
        </a>, e.g. by running <code>nvm install 16.3.0</code> and activating
        that version with <code>nvm activate 16.3.0</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app">
          Install create-react-app
        </a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you don't already have a place where you keep your coding projects,
        you should probably make one. I use <code>~/dev</code>. Switch to that
        directory in your terminal; you'll be storing your React app here.
      </li>
      <li>
        Follow the <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#setup-option-2-local-development-environment">
          local development instructions in the React tutorial
        </a> to set up your app using create-react-app
        (Node will automatically install create-react-app, after prompting you
        for confirmation,when you run the command).
      </li>
      <li>
        Follow the rest of the instructions in the React tutorial linked above.
      </li>
      <li>
        Refer to the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html">
          React docs
        </a> for conceptual help on various parts of React as needed.
      </li>

      </li>
      <li>
        Profit.
