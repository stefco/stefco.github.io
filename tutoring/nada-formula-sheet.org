** Energy

*** Conservation of energy

    /Explanation:/ The final total energy of a system (the sum of all kinetic
    #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
    ($K_f$)
    #+END_EXPORT
    and potential
    #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
    ($U_f$)
    #+END_EXPORT
    energy terms) will be exactly the same as the initial total
    energy plus the work
    #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
    ($W$)
    #+END_EXPORT
    done on the system by an external force.

    #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
    $$
    \Sigma U_i + \Sigma K_i + W = \Sigma U_f + \Sigma K_f
    $$
    #+END_EXPORT

*** Work done by a force

    /Explanation:/ If a force acts on an object while the object is moving,
    #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
    then the work done on the object is just the product of the force $F$,
    the total distance traveled $d$, and the cosine of the angle between
    the displacement and the force ($\theta$). This is true even if the motion
    was not in a straight line; $d$ is just the total change in position.

    $$
    W = F d cos(\theta)
    $$

*** Relationship between work and potential energy

    /Explanation:/ The work done by a conservative force is simply the change in
    *potential energy*, albeit with a negative sign in front (since the energy
    /lost/ by the potential is /gained/ by the system, or vice versa).

    #+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
    $$
    W = -\Delta U = - (U_f - U_i)
    $$
