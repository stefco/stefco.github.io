      ...the indeterminacy [quantum mechanics] introduces into the results of
      observations is of a kind which is philosophically satisfying, being
      readily ascribable to an inescapable crudeness in the means of
      observation available for small-scale experiments.

    <blockquote>
       Such a captive maiden, having plenty of time to think, soon realizes
       that her tower, its height and architecture, are like her ego only
       incidental: that what really keeps her where she is is magic, anonymous
       and malignant, visited on her from outside and for no reason at all.
       Having no apparatus except gut fear and female cunning to examine this
       formless magic, to understand how it works, how to measure its field
       strength, count its lines of force, she may fall back on superstition,
       or take up a useful hobby like embroidery, or go mad, or marry a disk
       jockey. If the tower is everywhere and the knight of deliverance no
       proof against its magic, what else?

      bestow life on what had persisted, to try to be what Driblette was, the

      pulsing stelliferous Meaning, all in a soaring dome around her?

      If American and European men-of-war now peacefully ride in once savage
      harbors, let them fire salutes to the honor and glory of the whale-ship,
      which originally showed them the way, and first interpreted between them
      and the savages. They may celebrate as they will the heroes of Exploring
      Expeditions, your Cookes, your Krusensterns; but I say that scores of
      anonymous Captains have sailed out of Nantucket, that were as great, and
      greater, than your Cooke and your Krusenstern. For in their succorless
      empty-handedness, they, in the heathenish sharked waters, and by the
      beaches of unrecorded, javelin islands, battled with virgin wonders and
      terrors that Cooke with all his marines and muskets would not have
      willingly dared.

      Know ye now, Bulkington? Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally
      intolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid
      effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea; while the
      wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the
      treacherous, slavish shore?

      <br/><br/>

      But as in landlessness alone resides highest truth, shoreless, indefinite
      as God- so better is it to perish in that howling infinite, than be
      ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety! For
      worm-like, then, oh! who would craven crawl to land! Terrors of the
      terrible! is all this agony so vain? Take heart, take heart, O
      Bulkington! Bear thee grimly, demigod! Up from the spray of thy
      ocean-perishing- straight up, leaps thy apotheosis!

      That same infinitely thin, isinglass substance, which, I admit, invests
      the entire body of the whale, is not so much to be regarded as the skin
      of the creature, as the skin of the skin, so to speak; for it were simply
      ridiculous to say, that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is
      thinner and more tender than the skin of a new-born child.

    <blockquote>
      In life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among
      the many marvels he presents. Almost invariably it is all over obliquely
      crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in thick array,
      something like those in the finest Italian line engravings. But these
      marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above
      mentioned, but seem to be seen through it, as if they were engraved upon
      the body itself. Nor is this all. In some instances, to the quick,
      observant eye, those linear marks, as in a veritable engraving, but
      afford the ground for far other delineations. These are hieroglyphical;
      that is, if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids
      hieroglyphics, then that is the proper word to use in the present
      connexion.

      It does seem to me, that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong
      individual vitality, and the rare virtue of thick walls, and the rare
      virtue of interior spaciousness. Oh, man! admire and model thyself after
      the whale! Do thou, too, remain warm among ice. Do thou, too, live in
      this world without being of it. Be cool at the equator; keep thy blood
      fluid at the Pole. Like the great dome of St. Peter's, and like the great
      whale, retain, O man! in all seasons a temperature of thine own.

      Your heart is like a great river after a long spell of rain, spilling
      over its banks. All signposts that once stood on the ground are gone,
      inundated and carried away by that rush of water. And still the rain
      beats down on the surface of the river. Every time you see a flood like
      that on the news you tell yourself: That's it. That's my heart.

      All Property, indeed, except the Savage's temporary Cabin, his Bow, his
      Matchcoat, and other little Acquisitions, absolutely necessary for his
      Subsistence, seems to me to be the Creature of public Convention. Hence
      the Public has the Right of Regulating Descents, and all other
      Conveyances of Property, and even of limiting the Quantity and the Uses
      of it. All the Property that is necessary to a Man, for the Conservation
      of the Individual and the Propagation of the Species, is his natural
      Right, which none can justly deprive him of: But all Property superfluous
      to such purposes is the Property of the Publick, who, by their Laws, have
      created it, and who may therefore by other Laws dispose of it, whenever
      the Welfare of the Publick shall demand such Disposition. He that does
      not like civil Society on these Terms, let him retire and live among
      Savages. He can have no right to the benefits of Society, who will not
      pay his Club towards the Support of it.
