    I'll be adding more notes as I go.

          The effect of temperature on your dough's fermentation.
        </a>
        If your fermentation is going faster or slower than expected, check out
        this writeup on how temperature affects flavor and fermentation time.
        The most important bit is this (very approximate) table:

        <table>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td></td>
              <td>
                <strong>Temperature</strong>
                <br>
                <strong>Range</strong>
              </td>
              <td>
                <strong>Fermentation</strong>
                <br>
                <strong>Time</strong>
              </td>
              <td>
                <strong>Flavor</strong>
                <br>
                <strong>Outcome</strong>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>
                <strong>Hot </strong>(e.g. Very Hot Sunny Day)
              </td>
              <td><strong>82F - 85F</strong> (28C - 29C)</td>
              <td><strong>Short</strong> (4 - 6 hours)</td>
              <td>
                <strong>Base Sourness</strong>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Warm </strong>(e.g. Room Temperature)</td>
              <td><strong>70F - 75F</strong> (21C - 24C)</td>
              <td><strong>Medium</strong> (6 - 12 hours)</td>
              <td><strong>Mild</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Cold </strong>(e.g. Fridge Temperature)</td>
              <td><strong>35F - 50F</strong> (2C - 10C)</td>
              <td><strong>Long</strong> (12 - 24+ hours)</td>
              <td><strong>Tangy Sourness</strong></td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips and Tricks/Troubleshooting</h2>

    <h3>Track how much your dough has risen</h3>
    <p>
      Track how far your dough has risen by cutting off a little chunk (after
      you've mixed the ingredients and let it settle for an hour or so) and
      putting it in a small, transparent container (like a shotglass with
      flat sides). Flatten the dough, cover the top, and mark the height of
      the dough with a rubber band. This way you can easily see when the
      dough has expanded by about 40-50% from it's starting size, at which
      point it will be ready for final proofing.

      The nice thing about doing it this way is that you don't have to worry
      about the exact temperature or timing (which will vary from day-to-day
      anyway); instead, you just check on your little dough sample whenever you
      stretch and fold, and when it's risen enough, you're done!
    </p>

    <h3>Control the fermentation speed</h3>
    <p>
      You can speed up your fermentation by putting it somewhere warm; usually
      you can just put it in the oven with the light on to provide a little bit
      of heat. Some ovens will warm the dough too much, so make sure to check
      on the temperature and rise every half hour or so. This is a nice trick
      when it's getting cold and late and it looks like the dough won't rise
      enough for final proofing before bed.
    </p>

    <h3>Make sure the dough can breath/dry during final proofing</h3>
    <p>
      If you don't have a bread basket, make sure to put some kind of cloth on
      the bottom of your bowl to wick away moisture from the dough. Since
      sourdgough has a lot of water in it, it needs a bit of firmness in the
      skin (like a water baloon) to keep it's shape (or else it will flatten
      like a pancake when you take it out to bake). Also make sure not to fully
      cover the top (with saran wrap or the like); putting a small plate on top
      should allow enough drying to give you a firm, workable skin.
